# A web-based layout converter with Rulemak, Colemak[-DH], Workman and other layouts

Based on https://colemak.com/Converter, this webpage provides an easy way to use non-standard layouts on computers where they are not installed.

It may be helpful for text editing on public computers where the nessesarry keyboard layout can not be installed natively.

Supported layouts:

* QWERTY
* Colemak
* Colemak-DH
* Rulemak
* Dvorak
* Workman
* Custom 1
* Custom 2

Don't forget to periodically transfer typed text to a main editing app, as web-based text editors are unstable. Usage of [PKL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pkl/) or PKL-like apps instead if possible is recommended.
